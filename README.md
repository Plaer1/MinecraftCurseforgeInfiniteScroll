# Infinite Scroll on Minecraft CurseForge Mods

This is a user script that enables infinite scrolling on the Minecraft CurseForge mod pages. The script uses the [infinite-scroll.js](https://infinite-scroll.com/) library to dynamically load more pages as the user scrolls down the page. This eliminates the need for pagination controls and provides a seamless browsing experience.

## Installation

To use this script, you will need a user script manager extension such as [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) or [Greasemonkey](https://www.greasespot.net/).

Once you have a user script manager installed, you can install the script by following these steps:

1. Click [here](https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO/raw/main/SCRIPT.user.js) to open the script file.
2. Your user script manager should prompt you to install the script.
3. Follow the prompts to complete the installation.

## Usage

Once the script is installed, simply visit any CurseForge mod page and start scrolling. The script will automatically load more pages as you scroll down.

The current page count is displayed in the bottom-right corner of the screen.
